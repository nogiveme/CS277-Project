\subsection{Overview}
This project aims to develop a multimodal Transformer-based framework for comprehensive financial risk prediction and correlation analysis.
The core methodology involves the integration of dynamic time-series data (e.g., daily K-line, returns, volatility, trading volume) and static structural data (e.g., corporate financial statements, leverage ratios, profitability, and macroeconomic indicators).
By leveraging deep attention mechanisms, the proposed model will capture both temporal dependencies and cross-modal relationships, allowing for interpretable and robust forecasting of credit, market, and liquidity risks.
